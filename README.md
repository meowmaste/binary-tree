## Binary Tree Traversal 
----

The challenge:

Because of recent security breaches, Apple has decided that each member of their executive team can only handle overseeing 2 other people at a time. 

They are restructuring, to look like this:

Name    Report 1    Report 2
Tim     Jony        Phil
Phil    Craig       Eddie
Jony    Dan         Katie
Katie   Peter       Andrea
 
This table isn't very DRY. It can be better represented by a binary tree. 

Create a data structure in Ruby to represent this data.

Now display the data. There are 3 ways to do "depth-first" traversal of a tree: have your data structure display the data in each of the 3 ways.
